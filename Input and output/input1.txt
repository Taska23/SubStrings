The Quick Search algorithm uses only the bad-character shift table (see chapter Boyer-Moore algorithm). After an attempt where the window is positioned on the text factor y[j .. j+m-1], the length of the shift is at least equal to one. So, the character y[j+m] is necessarily involved in the next attempt, and thus can be used for the bad-character shift of the current attempt.

The bad-character shift of the present algorithm is slightly modified to take into account the last character of x as follows: for c in Sigma, qsBc[c]=min{i : 0  < i leq m and x[m-i]=c} if c occurs in x, m+1 otherwise (thanks to Darko Brljak).

The preprocessing phase is in O(m+sigma) time and O(sigma) space complexity.

During the searching phase the comparisons between pattern and text characters during each attempt can be done in any order. The searching phase has a quadratic worst case time complexity but it has a good practical behaviour.
